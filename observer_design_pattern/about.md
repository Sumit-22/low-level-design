# Observer Design Pattern

Establishing a one-to-many dependency between objects where one object (the subject) notifies multiple observers about its state changes.

## Key Components:
- **Subject (Observable)**: Maintains a list of observers, notifies them of state changes.
- **Observer**: Defines an update method to receive and respond to subject notifications.
- **Concrete Observer**: Implements the observer interface, responds to updates from the subject.

## Advantages:
- **Loose Coupling**: Promotes decoupling between subjects and observers, allowing changes in one without affecting the other.
- **Dynamic Registration**: Supports dynamic addition and removal of observers at runtime.
- **Broadcast Notification**: Facilitates broadcasting state changes to multiple interested parties.
- **Event Handling**: Commonly used for event handling systems and UI components.

## Disadvantages:
- **Ordering Dependencies**: The order in which observers are notified can be crucial in some cases.
- **Complexity**: In complex systems, managing observers and notifications can become intricate.

## Examples:
- **Event Handling**: GUI frameworks for responding to user actions.
- **Stock Market Updates**: Notify multiple subscribers of price changes.
- **Weather Forecast**: Disseminating weather updates to various weather apps.
- **Chat Applications**: Informing users about new messages in group chats.
- **Traffic Management**: Real-time traffic updates to GPS navigation systems.
- **Monitoring Systems**: Alerting administrators to system health changes.
