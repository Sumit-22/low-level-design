# **Abstract Factory Pattern**

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is appropriate when you need to create **families of related or dependent objects** without specifying their concrete classes.

---

## **Key Characteristics**
- Useful for building **complex systems** with **multiple interrelated objects**.
- Uses **multiple abstract factory classes** (one for each family of objects).
- **Concrete factory classes** implement these abstract factories to create families of related objects.

---

## **Key Components**
- **Abstract Factory**: Declares factory methods for creating objects belonging to a family.
- **Concrete Factory**: Implements the abstract factory, creating a family of related objects.
- **Products**: Classes that implement a **common interface** or extend a **common base class** within a family.

---

## **Problem Solved**
- Addresses the challenge of **creating complex systems** with multiple interrelated objects.
- Ensures that objects created by a factory are **consistent** and **compatible** with each other.
- **Promotes scalability** by allowing the addition of **new families of objects**.
