# **Template Design Pattern**

The **Template Design Pattern** defines the **skeleton** of an algorithm, allowing certain steps to be implemented by subclasses while maintaining the overall structure.

---

## **Key Components**

- **Abstract Template**: Declares the structure of the algorithm with placeholder methods.
- **Concrete Templates**: Implement specific versions of the algorithm by filling in the placeholder methods.

---

## **Advantages**

- **Code Reuse**: Promotes reuse of common algorithm structures among multiple subclasses.
- **Consistency**: Enforces a consistent algorithm structure across subclasses.
- **Extensibility**: Allows for the customization of specific algorithm steps.
- **Reduced Duplication**: Minimizes duplicated code in similar algorithms.

---

## **Disadvantages**

- **Complexity**: Can introduce complexity when there are many optional steps or hook methods.

---

## **Use Cases**

- **Report Generation**: Creating report templates with variable sections or data sources.
- **Web Page Generation**: Defining a common structure for web page rendering with customizable content.
- **Database Access**: Executing database queries with consistent connection management.
- **Test Automation**: Implementing test scripts with standardized setup and teardown steps.
